Brock University has access to scholarly databases (a lot of them, actually. Over 450). The question is, what are they, how do they work, and how can you find and access them? The following interactive video will give you all the answers.

<p>In university, you'll often have to cite scholarly, peer reviewed information to back up your arguments and perspectives.
There are a lot of different options. Like journal articles, books,
book chapters, and more. It can get tricky making heads or tails
of peer review. This video will show you how.</p>

<p>
Using peer reviewed
information is important because of the unique quality control
process that this information must go through before it is published.
So, before an article, for example, is published
several other experts review the findings of the article to ensure
that the information is accurate and methods appropriate. In some cases,
the reviewers will reject the article. In others, they will
send the article back to the author and ask for specific revisions. In
very rare cases, the article is accepted without any revisions
at all. This process isn't perfect, and it can take
a very long time. But it's the main quality cont
rol process underpinning academic research since the first peer reviewed
journal in 1665.

It can be really frustrating working with
all the different types of information out there. If you ever need a helping hand
just reach out to a librarian. We're here to help.

    x.className = x.className.replace(" w3-show", "");
