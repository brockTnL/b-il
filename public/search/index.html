It can get tricky making sense of all of these terms. This video will show you how.\nSo, what's a scholarly article and why is it so important? A scholarly article is a document written by an academic for other experts and academics, to communicate new information and findings or arguments. Scholarly articles are unique because of the peer-review process that makes them happen. Before an article is published, several other experts in a field review the findings of the article to make sure that the research is accurate and that the methods are appropriate. This process isn't fool proof and it can take a long time. But it has been the main process underpinning academic research since the first publication in 1665.\nPeer reviewed articles are sometimes tricky to find, but they generally include the following: the name of the journal, which you should double check to ensure is legitimate. Author details, including where the author works, their degrees, and an email address or alternative way to contact them. Keywords and an abstract describing the study in question; while this varies from discipline to discipline, there is a recognizable structure to a journal article including an introduction, a research question or problem, a methodology, and evidence of findings. In addition to a conclusion or summary. And finally there are also citations and reference lists, pointing to other works that the author consulted prior to publishing their own findings.\nScholarly sources also include books and book chapters. A scholarly book is also written by an expert in a field, and is usually published by a reputable publisher, like a university press. Scholarly books are sometimes written by a single author, or written by multiple authors. In other cases, one or more editors join the writing of many different authors into an edited collection of essays.

You’re probably used to writing bibliographies towards the end of a research assignment; annotated bibliographies come at the beginning of the research process. Figuring out annotated bibliographies is an important skill that will serve you well even after you’ve finished your studies. This video will show you how.\nYou may have had to write a bibliography for a paper in the past. You attach it to the end of your assignment, using it to point to sources that you’ve referenced. An annotated bibliography is different in that it usually is completed before you dive into the assignment. Your course instructor likely has specific instructions about what they’d like to see included in your annotated bibliography; however, the following should apply in most circumstances. There are two main elements of an annotated bibliography: 1)\tThe citation 2)\tThe annotation\nThe citation is simply a record of the scholarly source you’ve selected in your instructor’s preferred style, like Chicago Style, or APA. The annotation is a little more involved. In several sentences, you should outline the main arguments of the source; assess the strengths and weaknesses of the source; and explain how and why the source is appropriate for your essay or research. Remember, an annotation is not simply a summary of the source. It is a critical summary, demonstrating that you’ve engaged with the source and have synthesized it’s value. For example, say you’ve included an article in your annotated bibliography that was published several decades ago by an influential scholar in the field. After scanning the source, you may want to explain that despite the publication date, the source is important because of the innovative methods used by the scholar at the time. Those methods may have influenced other scholars down the line, which may also appear in your annotated bibliography. Despite the importance of this source, you will also want to point to weaknesses: perhaps the data collection methods are not as robust as they could be, or you find the author’s theoretical approach inappropriate for the contemporary field. Finally, you’ll want to explain how the source will fit into your work: such as during the literature review. You have a lot of latitude in an annotation. Just remember to engage fully with the source and analyze it for its value, rather than summarizing its content. Sometimes, the annotated bibliography is a standalone assignment. In other cases, the annotated bibliography is the first step in a larger research project. Your annotated bibliography will be more helpful later if you front load some effort. For instance, your annotated bibliography will remind you why you selected a certain source; why a source is relevant; and why you agree or disagree with the source’s argument.

Maybe you didn’t include enough peer-reviewed sources, or the sources that you did include were not appropriate or current. Well, in this short video we’ll walk you through evaluating sources so that you can nail that assignment. When you’re trying to find resources for an assignment, like a research paper or annotated bibliography you need to be confident that you’re selecting the best resources for the task. One strategy that you can use is called RADAR. RADAR is a list of questions you can ask to ensure that the source that you’re using is credible, relevant, and appropriate for the assignment at hand. RADAR stands for: rationale, authority, date, accuracy, relevance. Rationale: why does a source exist? It’s important to consider why the source was created in the first place. Is it to demonstrate research findings? To persuade or inform the public; or to sell you something? Is it funded by a particular organization? These are questions you should ask. Authority: where is the information published, and who wrote it? You should investigate the author ensuring that they’re experts in the field. Look for academic titles, credentials such as terminal degrees and a record of publication in a specific field. Date: Date, or currency, is important to note because information can quickly become obsolete. Supporting your research with facts that have been superseded by new research or recent events weakens your overall argument. And not all assignments require the most current information. Older materials can provide valuable information, such as a historical overview of your topic. And remember, currency depends on the discipline, so make sure to get clarification prior to including a source in your assignment. Accuracy: Accuracy is important because errors and untruths distort a line of reasoning. It’s important to look for certain markers of accuracy in the evidence that you cite. For example, make sure to look for evidence of research findings, a definite research methodology, and a reference list, among other elements. Relevance: Relevance is important because you’re expected to support your ideas and arguments with pertinent and on-topic information. A source detailing Napoleon’s exploits in Russia wouldn’t be very helpful for a paper on the indie-classic, Napoleon Dynamite. So, ask yourself, does the information you’re about to cite relate to the assignment topic? And, does the information meet the stated requirements of your assignment. It can be really frustrating working with all of the different types of information out there. If you ever need a helping hand, just reach out to a librarian.

There are different types of sources available and different ways to interpret and use them in your work. This video will show you how.  Primary sources are immediate, first-hand accounts on a particular topic. Primary sources often contain an author’s own account on a specific topic or event. Primary sources can also include the direct result of an experiment or phenomenon. For example, diaries, speeches, letters, interviews, audio or video recordings are considered primary sources, as are raw data from a scientific experiment or survey.  You’ll often have to analyze primary sources as evidence for a particular argument. For example, you may need to analyze a series of letters and diary entries in a history class to point to a specific historical phenomenon that you’ve observed; alternatively, you may have to analyze survey results to assess whether there is a relationship between participants and their answers.  You’ll need to support your primary sources with secondary sources. Secondary sources describe, summarize, or discuss information derived from primary sources. Secondary sources offer a layer of interpretation and analysis that is critical for your assignments, because you’ll need to contextualize your work by drawing from other experts working on this topic. For example, books, scholarly articles, and conference proceedings are considered secondary sources.  While you’ll analyze primary sources, you’ll have to rely on secondary sources to contextualize your efforts. For example, you’ll want to use secondary sources, such as a chapter in a textbook on research methods, to describe the technique that you applied in analyzing your survey results. Alternatively, you may want to explain how other scholars have analyzed a particular film by including their scholarly articles and books in your literature review.  Here’s a final example to illustrate this point:  For your essay on Plato’s The Republic, you’re asked to include one primary source and two secondary sources. Your copy of Plato’s The Republic is your primary source, because it is the main account that you’ll be analyzing. Using the Library, you find a peer-reviewed journal article and a book chapter that also interpret Plato’s The Republic; these are your secondary sources. You’ll cite them in your essay, using them to support or contextualize your analysis.  It can be really frustrating working with all the different types of information out there.

            "content": "Please watch the following video (3:20) on strategies for evaluating information sources.\n  Video transcript\nNarrator: Have you ever received a marked assignment that you thought you aced, only to find that you misunderstood a few important aspects? Maybe you didn’t include enough peer-reviewed sources, or the sources that you did include were not appropriate or current. Well, in this short video we’ll walk you through evaluating sources so that you can nail that assignment. When you’re trying to find resources for an assignment, like a research paper or annotated bibliography you need to be confident that you’re selecting the best resources for the task. One strategy that you can use is called RADAR. RADAR is a list of questions you can ask to ensure that the source that you’re using is credible, relevant, and appropriate for the assignment at hand. RADAR stands for: rationale, authority, date, accuracy, relevance. Rationale: why does a source exist? It’s important to consider why the source was created in the first place. Is it to demonstrate research findings? To persuade or inform the public; or to sell you something? Is it funded by a particular organization? These are questions you should ask. Authority: where is the information published, and who wrote it? You should investigate the author ensuring that they’re experts in the field. Look for academic titles, credentials such as terminal degrees and a record of publication in a specific field. Date: Date, or currency, is important to note because information can quickly become obsolete. Supporting your research with facts that have been superseded by new research or recent events weakens your overall argument. And not all assignments require the most current information. Older materials can provide valuable information, such as a historical overview of your topic. And remember, currency depends on the discipline, so make sure to get clarification prior to including a source in your assignment. Accuracy: Accuracy is important because errors and untruths distort a line of reasoning. It’s important to look for certain markers of accuracy in the evidence that you cite. For example, make sure to look for evidence of research findings, a definite research methodology, and a reference list, among other elements. Relevance: Relevance is important because you’re expected to support your ideas and arguments with pertinent and on-topic information. A source detailing Napoleon’s exploits in Russia wouldn’t be very helpful for a paper on the indie-classic, Napoleon Dynamite. So, ask yourself, does the information you’re about to cite relate to the assignment topic? And, does the information meet the stated requirements of your assignment. It can be really frustrating working with all of the different types of information out there. If you ever need a helping hand, just reach out to a librarian.

            "content": "Many businesses employ full-time pricing analysts or hire an analyst as a consultant for a particular project or concern.\nPricing analysts look at industry standards, playing close attention to the pricing strategies of their competitors.\nThey use mathematical analysis to track pricing trends in the marketplace using industry databases, catalogues and other industry sources. They study consumer habits to determine how much people are willing to pay for various products, and to look for patterns in consumer spending.\nThey are also interested in the cost of production of various items, the amount of profit a company wants to make, and associated costs like marketing.\nThey may be involved with the packaging and presentation of products, which can influence how much people are willing to pay, and they provide advice during the research and development phase to help create the most income for the company.\nThey work with a variety of departments, including sales, product management, marketing and accounting, to ensure that their methods comply with company strategy and maximise profitability.\nOther duties that are included under a pricing analyst\u0026rsquo;s job title include maintaining price lists, contributing content for sales proposals, reviewing price quotes, generating pricing reports on sales revenue and preparing revenue forecasts and budgets for project managers.\n",

            "content": "Frequently Asked Questions What is this site for?    This site serves as a simple access point for learning objects associated with the Brock University Library. The learning objects featured here are meant for asynchronous, self-paced learning. They focus on skills related to library research and information literacy.   Who created this content?    The content featured here has been created by a team of librarians at Brock University. The site is managed by the eLearning Team.   How was this content created?    In most cases, each lesson is the product of a collaborative design effort, involving many different people. During our design and ideation stage, we followed these principles for eLearning.   Can I reuse this content?    Absolutely. Our content is licensed under a CC-BY-NC license, meaning you can freely use and remix our content (save for commercial purposes). Toss us an attribution if you would.   Are you collecting any data?    Yes. We collect data in two ways: the first is usage data collection through Google Analytics; the second through completely optional forms at the beginning and end of our lessons. We track engagement data through Google Analytics to give us a sense of the user\u0026rsquo;s experience on this site (bounce rates, popular content, unpopular content, referrals, etc). If you would prefer that your actions be excluded from our Google Analytics data, please install an extension for your browser (like this one for Chrome).\nWe track demographic and learner experience data through optional lesson surveys to help us understand our audience at a more granular level. You should not feel pressured to complete these surveys, though we appreciate any and all feedback. And please note that this data is only used for internal purposes: we will not use this data for anything other than this purpose without 1) ethics clearance and 2) participant consent.\n   I am having trouble exporting a lesson.    Please write to us to flag the issue. You can contact us using this site, or email us directly.   I am having trouble importing a lesson into Sakai (or another LMS).    We designed our exported lessons using the Common Cartridge standard, so that they are compatible with most learning management systems. Having said that, there are many moving pieces and something may have gone wrong. You can contact us using this site, or email us directly.   Can I contribute to this website?    Got an idea for a lesson, or want to help us make ours better? Sure thing. You can contact us using this site, or email us directly if you\u0026rsquo;d like to get involved.     ",
